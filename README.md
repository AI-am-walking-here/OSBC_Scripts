# AI am walking here's Bot Scripts

Welcome to the **AI_am_walking_here's** Bot Scripts Scripts repository! This is a place where I will create and share automation scripts for Old School RuneScape (OSRS). I'm excited to bring the power of automation to the game and enhance the gameplay experience.

## About

In this repository, you'll find a collection(*in due time*) of bot scripts designed to automate various tasks in OSRS. These scripts are developed with the aim of saving time and convenience. OSRS is a grind heavy game, but it doesn't have to be. It's also important to remeber real life comes first, so let the scripts worry about the pixels. **Enjoy your new found free time!!!**
