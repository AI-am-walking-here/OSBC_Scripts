def search_img_in_rect(image: Union[cv2.Mat, str, Path], rect: Union[Rectangle, cv2.Mat], confidence=0.04) -> Rectangle:
    """
    Searches for an image in a rectangle. This function works with images containing transparency (sprites).
    Args:
        image: The image to search for (can be a path or matrix). (template image)
        rect: The Rectangle to search in (can be a Rectangle or a matrix). (image to search )
        confidence: The confidence level of the search in range 0 to 1, where 0 is a perfect match.
    Returns:
        A Rectangle outlining the found image relative to the container, or None.
    Notes:
        If a matrix is supplied for the `rect` argument instead of a Rectangle, and the image is found within this matrix,
        the returned Rectangle will be relative to the top-left corner of the matrix. In other words, the returned
        Rectangle is not suitable for use with mouse movement/clicks, as it will not be relative to the game window.
        However, you will still be able to confirm if the image was found or not. This is useful in cases where you take a static
        screenshot and want to search for a series of images to verify that they are present.
    Examples:
        >>> deposit_all_btn = search_img_in_rect(BOT_IMAGES.joinpath("bank", "deposit.png"), self.win.game_view)
